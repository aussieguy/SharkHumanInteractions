//Problem: When the program first starts and there is no data in the database, it will read the sharkAttacks.csv file and create records for each line item.  The problem is that when it comes to lat/long we need to look up this data using geoCoder.  Apple's geoCoder can't be hit with over 6,400 records each requiring a look up for their lat/long.  After awhile geoCoder will time out and stop sending back lat/long data.
//Solution: The solution to the problem is to break the data import into two steps.
//  Step one is to read the sharkAttacks.csv file and create records for each line item AND DON'T look up the lat/long.
//  Step two is to run a separate program that takes each record from newly created database and then looks up the lat/long for it.  THERE IS A TIMER so for each record there is a 5 second pause.  This will prevent geoCoder from timing out.  Then a flat file is created that only has the uniqID and the lat/long details.

// Subsequently when the program is run the first time by the user, it will import the sharkAttacks.csv file and create a database for this.  It will then read the flat file and then take each line entry and update the corresponding record in the database with the lat/long data.  UniqID is used to look up.  We do it this way as it takes many hours to look up lat/long information via geoCoder and we can't have the user experiencing this delay.  We could write the lat/long information to the sharkAttacks.csv file as this would make importing into the database easier.  However, this file is just a download from the original source website and we want to leave it as original as possible.
