# SharkHumanInteractions

Shark Attacks is an iOS app that is a searchable (by name, year, country, state, location) database of all shark human interactions.  

Search results are displayed via text but also via pins on a map.  

Shark Attacks makes use of the global shark attack file which is an Excel file imported into the app.  Swiping down on the main screen will check for any updates and then integrate the updates into existing data.
